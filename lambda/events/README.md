## User Stories
As a mentor, i need to view the date and location of upcoming events so that i can schedule my attendance
As a mentor, I need to login via github
As a mentor, I need to sign up to an event so that CYF will know I am attending
As a mentor, I need to see what subjects / part of syllabus will be covered in the event so that I can be sure I am ready to teach it.


As an organiser, I need to create an event for a city so that mentors can sign up and get details of the class
As an organiser, I need to be able to see which mentors will be attending

Github api has teams for mentors and students already, so we could use that

## Notes from Kash...

### Current issues
Course organisers are not certain who definitely available each Sunday
Mentors are not sure which Sunday needs support more, as sometimes too many mentors show up
Current version at the events page has some basic functionality but lacks design/UX
Current version lists all events in one list, without any filters for different cities etc

### MVP
Anyone can view upcoming events in any of the cities, who is coming and sign up
Have an admin view to confirm who is a mentor/ who can add events

### Ideal / Future
Be able to have a course page where you can see all the modules and who is leading them and how many volunteers have committed
Send thank you for attending + feedback form to all those who attended a class
Be able to get a report of which mentors lead/attended which modules, be able to send them feedback form. Could tie attendance record to mentors page so that it is easy for students and coaches to see profiles of mentors?
Keep attendance of students and be able to get feedback from students who attended a class
Student Profiles for mentors to be able to get to understand a students background and what prior experience they have to better mentor them.
Mentors should be able to receive a general background of the students and areas where they need to work on.  

### Reference
Codebar sign-up process: the first UI is a bit confusing but the overall process itâ€™s very straightforward
