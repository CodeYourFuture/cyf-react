## Running offline

serverless offline is installed.
First a local DynamoDB needs to be setup. Java is required for this.
To setup DynamoDB run:

    yarn sls dynamodb install

Then to run the functions:

    yarn offline

In order to use the API, you may have to create the table `dev-events`.

### User Stories

* As a mentor, i need to view the date and location of upcoming events so that i can schedule my attendance
* As a mentor, I need to login via github
* As a mentor, I need to sign up to an event so that CYF will know I am attending
* As a mentor, I need to see what subjects / part of syllabus will be covered in the event so that I can be sure I am ready to teach it.

* As an organiser, I need to create an event for a city so that mentors can sign up and get details of the class
* As an organiser, I need to be able to see which mentors will be attending

Github api has teams for mentors and students already, so we could use that

* Location - Red Badger (inc googlemap)
* City - London
* Class - September 2017 (Class 3)
* Date - Sunday 12th November 2017
* Mentors - Matt, Kash, Mishal
* Sponsors - Github, Red Badger
* Details - Js Core 1 topics etc

### Serverless

* sls invoke --function create --path mocks/create-event.json
* sls invoke --function get --path mocks/get-event.json
* sls invoke --function list --path mocks/list-event.json
* sls invoke --function update --path mocks/update-event.json
* sls invoke --function delete --path mocks/delete-event.json

## Notes from Kash...

### Current issues

* Course organisers are not certain who definitely available each Sunday
* Mentors are not sure which Sunday needs support more, as sometimes too many mentors show up
* Current version at the events page has some basic functionality but lacks design/UX
* Current version lists all events in one list, without any filters for different cities etc

### MVP

* Anyone can view upcoming events in any of the cities, who is coming and sign up
* Have an admin view to confirm who is a mentor/ who can add events (should be solved by Github auth?)

### Ideal / Future

* Be able to have a course page where you can see all the modules and who is leading them and how many volunteers have committed
* Send thank you for attending + feedback form to all those who attended a class
* Be able to get a report of which mentors lead/attended which modules, be able to send them feedback form. Could tie attendanc to mentors page so that it is easy for students and coaches to see profiles of mentors
* Keep attendance of students and be able to get feedback from students who attended a class
* Student Profiles for mentors to be able to get to understand a students background and what prior experience they have to better mentor them.

### Reference

Codebar sign-up process: the first UI is a bit confusing but the overall process itâ€™s very straightforward
