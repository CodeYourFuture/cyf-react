      <p>We are a non-profit organisation supporting refugees with the dream of becoming developers.</p>
      <p>In their journey of interrupted lives, unfinished studies and integration challenges, many asylum seekers and refugees
      yearn to update their tech skills, but lack learning opportunities. <strong>We want to change this.</strong></p>
      <p>Last year we launched the first cohort of our  6-month web development programme, coached by a group of professional developers. Today we are running new classes in London and Glasgow. This is <strong>just the beginning</strong>. With your help we will be expanding to other regions and cities.</p>
